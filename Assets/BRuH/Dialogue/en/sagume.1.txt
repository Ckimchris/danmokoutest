 howling--
 twentieth-night moon`
slce surprise
.z `Ah, I see, you're that amanojaku-like Lunarian goddess. I had heard that your power forced you to stay silent, but you've found a brilliant workaround, haven't you?`
slce worry
.z `Well, not that impressive considering how long you've had to figure one out.`

 A frog jumps in,--
 The sound of the water`

.z `Sorry, I'm not that well-versed in parsing allegory. Can you make it a bit more, uh, understandable?`

.z `I see. We were all thinking that the Lunarians weren't taking the invasion incident seriously, given that they didn't even have the Watatsukis sally out.`

 all round, climbing through the dark
 at festival time`

slce angry
.z `I doubt that. I know all about how you Lunarians hate Earth art. You call it "impure" and all that jazz.`
.z `At the end of the day, you're probably a mole. I'm not letting you pass. Go back to the moon and take this little haiku with you:`
slce happy
.z `in this group of people
 admiring the full moon
 not one beautiful face`
