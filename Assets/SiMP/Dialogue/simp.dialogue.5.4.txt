. `Poisoning someone and then beating them up is a bit morally questionable, but you're the only one who can do it, Mokou.`

I guess I should have expected that fake hermit to betray me.`

Uh, excuse me. I mean--`

. `Fufufu, yes... You figured me out! Over the course of ten years of confinement I poured my evil power into your shrine!`

And if you're working with Mima to destroy this shrine, then I'll just have to exterminate you too.`
