z

You've seen the tower in the Forest of Magic, right?`
z
. `This device can send messages through the air to that tower, and that tower can send messages through the air to this device.`
z
. `So you can talk to anyone else with the same device, as long as you're both within range of the tower.`
z
srce happy
. `I sent Chen to deliver one to Kamishirasawa, along with my plans. I didn't expect you to get here before me, but with this device, you won't have to backtrack.`
z

. `Is that all?`
z
srce _
. `No, I have one more gift for you.
A warning.`
z
srce angry
. `Fujiwara. If you fail, I'll have to step in.
And that will be the second-worst outcome. For everyone.`
z
. `Don't screw up. Kamishirasawa might trust you, but I don't trust her and I don't trust you. I'm only working with you because I can't involve Reimu.`
z
srce happy
. `And on that note... I'm going to sleep. When I wake up, I expect to see this incident resolved.`

Hah! Do I have a beam in my eye or something?`

z
. `This incident is giving me a terrible sense of powerlessness. It's my job to protect Gensoukyou, but I can't even approach Reimu's shrine, let alone resolve the incident.`
z
. `Kasen... what should I do?`
z
slc
. `Ambition is what makes a youkai. If we can't yet defy the very laws of nature, then it simply means our ambition isn't grand enough.`
z
slce happy
. `One day, we'll reach for the moon, Yukari. And when that project is realized, nobody, not even the Hakurei god herself, will be able to stop us.`
z

z
srce surprise
. `Ah... actually, I think we might find a clue to that project in this incident.`
z
slce surprise
. `Really?`
z
srce _
. `I was thinking about some rumors from a couple years ago. Before you came back.`
z
. `Back then, some youkai were talking about a vengeful spirit trying to take over the Hakurei shrine. I even heard some claims that this spirit was actually some kind of astronomical deity.`
z
. `"God of the Eighty-Sixth Crescent Moon". I do remember this title pretty well. Journalistic instinct and all.`
z
slce worry
. `Eighty-six?`
z
srce worry
. `Supposedly, that's the number of gods in our realm. The number is wrong, but it's too obviously wrong to be wrong. I don't know what to make of it.`
z
. `Anyways, I know for a fact that Reimu sealed something powerful in the back of the shrine at about that time. And then the rumors stopped.`
z
slce _
. `I see. So you're hoping that a god named after an astronomical body would be willing to work with us to shatter the false skies.`
z
slce worry
. `But, supposing that Reimu sealed the Eighty-Sixth God of the Crescent Moon in the shrine. Even if this god happened to break out of the shrine last night, it wouldn't explain why the goshintai are acting up.`
z
srce _
. `My best guess is that the Hakurei god is involved in the jailbreak. Probably a petty grievance against Reimu.`
z
slce surprise
. `Gods hold grievances against their own shrine maidens? Times have changed...`
z
src
. `Other gods don't. But the Hakurei god is in a league of her own.`
z
srce happy
. `But enough thinking for now. With Reimu's shrine in this state, there's not much more I can do. 
So I'll get some sleep instead.`
z
slce happy
. `In that case, I'll stick around a bit longer.`
