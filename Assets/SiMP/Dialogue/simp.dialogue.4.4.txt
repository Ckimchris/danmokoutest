. `That was nice. I managed to punch out some of my frustration.
And? What did you want to talk about?`

srce _
. `Well, to switch gears quickly, I know why this incident is occurring.`
z
srce surprise
. `When I was still a vengeful spirit, Reimu sealed me inside the shrine several times.`
z
srce happy
. `Of course, I broke free every time (lol), but eventually she got pissed and used the power of the yin-yang orbs to seal me away properly.`
z
srce worry
. `Those orbs are... like sponges, I guess. They absorbed the evil from me until I became a pure divine soul.`
z
srce cry
. `The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away, as they say. I've turned into nothing more than an exceptionally strong prankster...`
z
srce _
. `And here's the important part. If you do something stupid like destroying the orbs or, I don't know, inverting the boundary of good and evil around them...`
z
srce surprise
. `All that evil energy is going to spread across Gensoukyou and make the fairies or weaker youkai go rabid.`
z
. `Your leader... Keine, right? She-`
z
slce angry
. `That's Professor Kamishirasawa to you.`
z
srce cry
. `Yes, of course. Professor Kamishirasawa probably planned for this contingency. But I can simply reclaim the energy and prevent any further issues.`
z
slce worry
. `Well, it should be trivial enough to put you down a second time.`
z
srce worry
. `No, no, that won't be necessary! Since my soul has been, uh, purified, there's no way that my reclaiming that energy could lead to any negative outcomes! (lie)`

z
slce surprise
. `...Yeah, how did you know?`
z
slce worry
. `...Second thoughts? Do we really have time to be worrying about them?`
z
. `...I guess that makes sense. Come over later and we'll work through it.`
z
