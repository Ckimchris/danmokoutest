. `"Aggh, my stomach!" Eirin's poison had resumed its effects. Reimu was once again bedridden.`
z
. `"Aggh..." There was one more patient at the clinic. "Why would you poison me too?"`
z
. `"Well, when I told Keine you might have turned back into an evil spirit, she proposed this as the easiest solution."`
z
. `It was difficult for me to look at her. We were, in some way, war buddies. It was a bit cruel of me to subject her to this.`
z
. `"Whoa, is that... Mima? Serves you-- right!" With barely any air in her lungs, Reimu's laugh could not even carry to the next bed.`
z
. `"Serves you right-- too, Reimu..."`
z
. `With some kind of machinery in her hand, Eirin waved her arm slowly over Mima. Nostalgic black smoke plumed out of the strange device.`
z
. `I've heard that normal people would do something similar when cooking over stoves, but as far as I can remember, I've always tested the fire by putting my hand in it.`
z
. `"Well, it looks like whatever 'evil' you absorbed from this incident didn't affect you significantly. It should be safe to let you free."`
z
. `"Hear that, Reimu? I'm a good guy now... (lie)"`
z
. `"Ha, like I... care! Gonna seal you up again... anyways!"`
z
. `Nobody bothered to stop the pair's half-delirious bickering now that Reimu's anger had subsided to a normal level.`
z
. `Eirin assured us that Reimu wouldn't remember any of this, so I'm hoping that Mima can make a better first impression when the two are up and about.`
z
. `Turns out that erasing someone's memories is quite easy when they're sleeping on the bed right in front of you. Maybe that's what happened to Aya?`
z
. `Eirin, having completed her checkup, turned to me. "I'm sorry, Fujiwara. I didn't think that you'd run into Kaguya and then summarily get your liver beaten out of you.`
z
. `I thought you were stronger than that. But next time I'll be careful to keep Kaguya informed. It would be a problem if you had to take a day off due to an unexpected death, right?"`
z
. `Nice try. I'm too old to fall for that.`
z
. `"I should be thankful Kaguya normally handles me with kid gloves. Otherwise I'd spend half my life in bed healing off my injuries. Like that pink rabbit over there. What the hell did you do to her?"`
z
. `She turned away, apparently disappointed. I think she underestimates me. That's fine. It's easier that way.`
z
. `As Mima had promised, there were no serious consequences to this incident. There was no reason for me to be here anymore.`
z
. `I left Eientei and weaved through the thickest clusters of the forest, heading towards the lake near my hut.`
z
. `But by the time I reached the lake, the nightbugs had already begun their disorganized, yet somehow harmonious, rehearsal. 
I screwed up. It's too late to fish today.`
z
. `I sat down, pushing my back against one of the smoother trees. Sleeping against rough tree bark is nice, but sleeping against a familiar tree is slightly better.`
z
. `Yet in the process of becoming familiar with a tree, you inevitably sand away at its rough edges. This is, in some form, the paradox of immortality itself.`
z
. `I pray every night to wake up with the desire to do something.`
z
. `In this life where the consequences of every action will crumble before my own eyes, where there is no movement or goal with any meaning, the most valuable feeling is that of a random and shallow impulse to act.`
z
. `Without those capricious moments, I might give up on getting up altogether.`
z
. `I turned my head to face the flattened circle of grass where, had I come earlier, I would have sat. The gear I had left there in the morning lay unmoving, untouched.`
z
. `Nowadays, the only whims I come across involve fishing, eating with Keine, or killing Kaguya. I need to treasure them better.`
z
. `With that last thought, I leaned my head against the tree bark and slept.`
z
. `(Bad End! Try for a 1CC next time!)`
