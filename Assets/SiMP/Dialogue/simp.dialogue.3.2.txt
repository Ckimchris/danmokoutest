. `Had enough? Let's hear you spit it out. What were you doing?`
z
src
. `Fine. I wasn't doing anything. This incident isn't my fault.`
z
slc
. `And what about Aya? Was that your fault?`
z
srce worry
. `Oh, did the reporter forget me? That's... sort of my fault. More like an inevitability, I guess. By the time this incident is cleared up three days from now, the miser and the thief will also have forgotten me.`
z
slce worry
. `Three days? I was planning to clear out this incident within three hours...`
z
srce _
. `Your involvement in the incident ends today. The title of Incident Resolver is a transient privilege. It shall rest on your shoulders for but a moment, and, if you play your cards right, never again.`
z
. `That said, you too will forget me. When you recount the tale of this incident to your friends some months from now, the space I now occupy will contain only nothingness.`
z
. `Nothing to do with this incident, anyways. The title of God of Secrets is a heavy burden. Those two schemers know all about it, so bug them for the details.`
z
slce angry
. `And? Where's the rest of your confession?`
z
srce worry
. `I told you! This incident isn't my fault!`
z
. `Look. Think of it this way. The reporter told you about the incident I actually caused, right? I infected almost every fairy in Gensoukyou and threw the natural order of this plane into chaos. In three days.`
z
. `How long has the Skyfeller been--`
z
slce worry
. `Skyfeller? What?`
z
srce angry
. `Damned millenials! Do you even read the news?! I swear, it's because the lot of you are so irresponsible that Gensoukyou has gone down the drain recently. Since you fools can't get your act together and maintain the balance of Gensoukyou, I have to start getting involved in incident politics again! Lazy entitled shitheads! Have some respect for your elders and let us retire in peace!`
slc
. `(I don't know what's going on, but I better shut this boomer up.)`
z
. `Oh, yeah, my bad, of course I know about the Skyfeller. I thought you said Sky<i>fooler</i>. Please, continue.`
z
srce worry
. `...I guess even a millenial would know about the greatest oni to ever lay foot on Gensoukyou's soil, right? Well, whatever.`
z
srce _
. `The Skyfeller has been screwing around with the Hakurei orbs for a few weeks now. With that kind of time, I could turn 93.7% of the living beings in Gensoukyou into puppets. I even wrote a paper on it.`
z
. `You think I'd waste my time playing pranks on some some stupid shrine maiden?
<size=52>Also, want to see the paper? It was a big deal, Nature doesn't publish disease pathology often. Not until 2020, anyways.</size>`
z
slc
. `I'll pass. Maybe when I have more time. 
So, if you're not the culprit, then why did you bring me here?`
z
src
. `Because one of our mutual friends asked me to find someone. Apparently you need this person's help to resolve the incident.
They're up ahead. Go meet them.`
z
slce _
. `Just one thing before I leave. 
What's your name?`
z
srce special
. `It's <color=red>[NULL REFERENCE EXCEPTION]</color>. You won't be able to remember it, so don't bother trying.
Just remember that I am the terrifying secret god of Gensoukyou, and that'll suffice.`
z
srce angry
. `Now leave and never come back here.`
