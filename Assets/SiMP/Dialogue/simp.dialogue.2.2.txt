. `Eirin's part of the operation, isn't she? Why did she have you come out here? And where's the rabbit?`
z
srce worry
. `I don't know about an operation... Eirin just asked me to collect some rare poisonous mushrooms and to absolutely not be seen...`
z
srce happy
. `And Reisen is serving as guine-- excuse me, Tewi made her eat something weird, so she's resting at Eientei.`
z
slce angry
. `That damn pharmacist should put herself in others' shoes sometimes.`
z

. `Well, if you had attacked Yukari like that, you probably would have gotten killed. Count yourself lucky you ran into me.`
z
srce happy
. `That's just the risk of picking mushrooms here, right? Even now, she might appear out of thin air and murder us both.
Could you call that lover's suicide, technically?`
z
slce worry
. `That... probably won't happen. Not today, anyways.`
z
slce _
. `As it turns out, I'm working with Keine, Eirin, Yukari, and a few more people on a conspiracy to save Gensoukyou.`
z
.`I don't know why Eirin hasn't told you about this. But you should know.`
z
. `The Hakurei shrine is going to explode. And if Reimu gets involved, it's going to get worse.`
z
. `It's something to do with those weird orbs she always carries around. They've been corrupted.`
z
. `For any of this to work, we need to put Reimu out of commission. I assume those mushrooms are for some kind of poison.`
z
srce cry
. `So you and Reisen get to do incident resolution before me? I feel left out now. `
z
slce worry
. `You're too lazy to do incident resolution.`
z
srce angry
. `I'm not lazy, I'm busy! Busy playing video games! 
But I could spare enough time for one incident every fourteen months or so.`
z
slce _
. `In that case, why not just take the next job from the real rabbit?`
z
srce happy
. `That's it! I can even bribe her with some time off.`
srce worry
.cn `Oh, I shouldn't keep you any longer. I need to get back to Eientei. I'll ask Eirin for the details.`
z
slc
. `In that case, when you're there, tell Eirin this:
"Because you didn't explain the context behind this mushroom-gathering trip, I nearly incapacitated Mokou and threw the whole plan into chaos."`
z
srce happy
. `Is that how it is? Were my imitation danmaku that difficult for you to dodge? You've lost your edge.`
z
slce angry
. `Don't act so damn haughty when people are trying to help you!
I just want her to stop leaving you out of the loop. Because it causes problems for me. That's all.`
z
srce worry
. `If you say so...
Oh, also, are we still on for day after tomorrow?`
z
slce _
. `As long as this incident is resolved by then.
Well, I still want to go fishing today, so I'm planning to clean it all up within a few hours.`
z
srce happy
. `Awesome! See you soon, then!`
